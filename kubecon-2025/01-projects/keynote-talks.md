# Highlights
* Google: Dynamic Multi Cluster scheduling
	* ![[20250402_094243 1.jpg]]
* SAP: Sovereign cloud-edge continuum for Europe
* CNCF: new certification (Certified Open Source Developer) aimed for enterprise grade organizations
* KubeCon + OpenInfra joined together
* K8S turns 10, see attachment for the history (and #cTENcf)
* Adopting projects within the CNFC: align the project goals with the business interests before bringing them in.
* Omni -> KGateway sandboxed project @ CNCF
	* Ambient -> Cost automation for sidecars
	* Migration tool -> from sidecars to Ambient
* Reimagine infra for AI-native systems and autonomous agents

## Ebay: ML & Observability
* Great lessons learned on how to actually utilize AI/ML wrt Observability
* Created a new nice set of building blocks / capabilities for Observability:
	* Anomaly detection
	* Root cause analysis
	* Auto remediation
## Michelin: scaling k8s while reducing costs
* Changing strategy: embrace open source, remain attractive to employees
	* MAKE instead of buy ONLY open source
* Great architecture picture -> see screenshot
	* Impact: decreased platform costs -44%, reduced leadtime -85%, Kubernetes footprint x2

## Redhat: rethinking cloud native systems for the age of AI
* Shift from chat to LLM -> break the monoliths again -> shift to distributed computing
* Analogy with k8s:
	* challenges with state -> limitations on k8s
* AI workloads (AI agents) don't just save state: they also share it
* NUMA Aware state scaling -> preserve state beyond pod restarts 
* Provided CNCF projects: Kueue, Envoy AI Gateway, KServe +vLLM, DAPR & DAPR Agents + OpenTelemetry
* Check Cloud native AI
* == Shift towards decentralised AI 

# Redefining MLops at scale
* Challenges with AI powered applications
* Kordent -> like a super control plane for k8s

# Building a PaaS for the Government
* Offentlich PaaS Norway
* Nais -> the platform created by Nav
* Also a great recruitment tool -> attracted a lot of developers just after Kubecon 2016
* Fully open source the platform -> replicate for NL???
	* https://offentlig-paas.no/ (learn the Norwegian language)
* Docs: https://docs.nais.io
* From 0 to 3000 deployments in production per week
* Later offered Nais as a Service (NaaS)
* Selling software without a Tendering process (5 page document -> search for it)
	* More difficult than making the platform

# Inclusion and accessibility
* A lot of focus for the following topics:
	* Inclusion of minorities
	* Deaf && || visually impaired people
	*  Keynote talks got sign language support & auto generated subtitles
	* Quiet, prayer rooms
	* Much attention to the LHBTIQ+ community
* With all of this, it comes more and more a "mainstream community" / conference
	* ppl feel welcomed and supported to join and contribute to the community
	* Reference Liz Rice & Katie Gamanji -> boost their career
