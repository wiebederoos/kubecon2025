# Gitpod
* Great to replace traditional VDIs
* Running in AWS (different EC2 instance types) -> only pay as you go
* Not Azure ready yet, perhaps coming in ~6 months
* Gitpod the company maintains, dev only used provisioned instances
* Freedom to choose tools for EC2 instance
* Compare with managed MacOS / Macbooks
	* Technically
	* Financially
* Happy to give a demo in on site
# Cloudsmith
* More modern package repository manager compared to Nexus and/or JFrog
* Blend of package manager, container registry and LCM/dependency scanner
* Running in AWS only, on-prem failover / standalone installation in GE and IE region
* Adopting Azure in the future
* See a big need in the "save on Egress costs" use case -> working on this feature - no ETA yet
* Happy to give a demo on site
# YugabyteDB
* Claim to be able to have legacy relational DBs migrated to Cloud native versions
* Also work on prem, open source and "as a Service"
* Handle scalability, distribution of workloads, security aspects and fast transactional access through multiple edge locations
* Can be an addition / replacement for PostgreSQL and/or other legacy DBs
* Company exists for ~10 years, happy to give a "remote demo"
# Buoyant
* Offers platform as a service based on backstage
* Claims to reduce the # of resources to maintain backstage
* Acknowledge backstage is perceived as hard to maintain / extend
* Offers not yet an on-prem solution, might come later
* No need to learn NodeJS to maintain it, all through the UI, stuff can be automated using the APIs
