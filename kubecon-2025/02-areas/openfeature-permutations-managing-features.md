# Speakers
* Prerit Munjal
# Context / use case
* Developing a feature experimentation framework -> prioritize experiments based on business impact
### why
* Features are business related instead of tech-related
	* Evaluate if users really want the product (or not)
	* Design your features for dumb and smart users at the same time
	* Not every idea is a feature -> use scoring cards to verify
	* Users are impatient, VCs are even more impatient
	* Create a maze and give hits (about the product is doing)
	* Focus on the end-user experience
### What
* 20 features = ... combinations (1.048.576)
* 20+ experiments > 2 groups of 26 developers
* FeatureS are a problem:
	* DEV team / AI conflicts
	* Limited visibility
	* Test matrix explosion
	* Unpredictable user experience
* Open Feature benefits
	* Centralized decision engine
	* Context propagation
	* Dynamic Rule evaluations
### How
* Feature management dashboard: see screenshot 
	* With metrics (see screenshot) before & after and improvements

### Wow
* Platform:
	* Comparability matrix
	* Phased roll-out strategy
	* Telemetry
	* Conversation funnel -> features 
# Comments
* Speaker also knows about differentiation between normal pods and secure pods
* Highlights of features offered by KubeTech
* Super fast talk, missed differentiation / split between the how and wow (makes the talk more clear) -> verify with the speaker
