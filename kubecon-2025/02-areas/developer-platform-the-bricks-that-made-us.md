# Speakers
* Paul Faver
* Thomas Ã˜ther Rasmussen

# Context / use case
* Lego container platform teams' view on onboarding new applications and keep developers happy.
* Utilize platform engineering and avoid shadow IT (don't frustrate developers - but keep the balance between autonomy and freedom)

# Establishing standards
Based on the typical mix of variety: autonomous teams, user variety, etc
* Seamless experience -> on-prem versus cloud based clusters
* Highly opinionated: No KubeCTL, only GitOps
* All included: Ingress, Certificates, DNS, Secret Management, Self Service

# Migration taskforce
* Ppl from the platform team, dev teammembers, consultants -> Join their dailies
* 3 archetypes:
	* 01 - Lift -> lot's of support to change their mindset + ongoing support due to personalities
	* NaN - Lift & Shift -> love experimentation and adopt recommendations, lot's of questions
	* 02 - Custom features -> where workloads won't fit best -> therefore create customize solutions / adaptions in the platform (immediately increasing technical debt)
* Adopting a sales mindset -> teams are still allowed to create their own solutions
	* Stages:
		* 1 - Workshops -> complete development workflow in one hour (low barrier, also just a workshop environment + support channel)
		* 2 - Events -> internal promotion and tech deepdives
		* 3 - Connect -> building relationships
		* 4 - Support rotation -> direct relationships between consumers and platform engineers (avoid single point of failures so everyone participates - dedicated 2 platform engineers). 
			* Also stop responding to individual messages
			* Community starts to help here
		* 5 - Rent-an-engineer -> temp join the consumer teams to develop custom features -> connectivity boost for productivity between teams
		* 255 - pair up -> skip all of the meetings except for the regular scrum events
	* Mixing tech and sales in every message
## Key takeaways
* Sell your platform
* Keep users close

# Comments
* Great story about user engagement
* 14 platform engineers
* 50 consumer teams
