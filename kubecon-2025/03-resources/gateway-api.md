# Context / description
The Gateway API is a Kubernetes project designed to manage traffic routing for both ingress (incoming) and service mesh (internal) communications. It provides a more flexible and role-oriented approach compared to traditional ingress controllers, allowing for advanced routing capabilities and better management of service interactions.
