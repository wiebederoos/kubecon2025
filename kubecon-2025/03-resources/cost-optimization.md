# Startups & grown up companies
* Many startups jumping in since Cloud bills are waaaaay to high
	* Companies don't dare to step up to this -> business case is still valid for startups
	* Seeing trends that companies leave the cloud partially due to high costs
* Companies:
	* CastAI
	* KubeCost
* Average cloud bill drop by ~50% (powerpoint proof)
* Support all major cloud providers and on-prem (limited)
	* SaaS product(s) offered
# Cost saving trends 
* Most companies trying to find the balance between CPU usage and memory usage:
	* Optimize usage of best SKUs based on workload demand
	* Optimize memory requests based on actual demand, never go below a certain threshol.
* Pack workloads on single nodes when possible: no separation based on legal and compliance related issues, only view from the technical perspective
* Usage of spot instances and also predict spot interruptions to avoid downtime when only spot instances are used
* Switch off nodes when not needed
